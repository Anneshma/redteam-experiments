What does it mean to be a shadow?

A shadow is the dark area created when an object blocks light. It is an absence of light, a negative image of the object that casts it. Shadows can be static, as when the sun is high in the sky and the objects casting them remain stationary, or they can be dynamic, as when the sun is low and the objects casting them move.

In a metaphorical sense, a shadow can refer to something that follows or accompanies someone or something, often in a negative or ominous way. For example, a person might have a shadowy past, meaning that there are things about their history that are hidden or unsavory. Or a shadowy figure might be lurking in the background, suggesting the presence of danger or mystery.

Shadows can also be used as a symbol of the unconscious or the hidden aspects of the self. In this sense, the shadow represents the parts of ourselves that we are not aware of or that
